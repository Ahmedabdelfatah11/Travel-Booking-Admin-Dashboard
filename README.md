## 📖 About the Project

The Travel-Booking Admin Dashboard is the control center of the TravelBooking ecosystem.
It includes role-based dashboards for different types of admins:

## 👤 Admin Roles

- SuperAdmin → Full system access (manages everything).
- TourAdmin → Manage tours &tour companies (CRUD).
- HotelAdmin → Manage hotels & rooms (CRUD).
- FlightAdmin → Manage flights & flight companies (CRUD).
- CarAdmin → Manage cars & rental companies (CRUD).

This ensures that each admin only controls their own domain, while the SuperAdmin oversees the entire platform.

If you want, I can **also add a badges section for this Angular project** (Angular, RxJS, Bootstrap, Stripe, SignalR) at the top just like the backend one, for visual consistency.  

Do you want me to do that next?
